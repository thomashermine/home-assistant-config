# cafetiere_timer_off
# Turn on cafetiere --> Start timer
#
# Cafetiere auto-shutdown (switch jumps to off) if left on for more than 30mn
# (some bullshit EU regulations stuff, like I'd care about fires)
# In that case, we loose control of it : the power outlet can't do anything
# we need to press the button on the appliance.
# A timer allows us to avoid that case.
# Cause we don't like pressing buttons.
# We have big fingers
