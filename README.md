# Home Assistant Config 

I‚Äôve been working on my smart home since 2013, in 3 different flats.

It all started with a cheap connected MiLight Light bulb... \
‚Äî¬†today, all my house is connected : every lights and switches, the heating system, various media players,...

The setup mainly consist of an Intel NUC running [Home Assistant](http://homeassistant.io/). \
I use lightbulbs from IKEA Tradfri, a few [Aqara](https://amzn.to/34WmDL9) sensors and a lot of [NodeMCU](https://amzn.to/34ZesO6) running [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).

### A note about the current status

I moved in October 2019 in a flat I'm the owner off, and that I'm completely renovating.

I took this opportunity to nuke my previous install and start again, with a clean & public codebase. \
I'm currently slowly re-importing automations & logics from my previous (private) repository.

Expect more awesomeness soon üòÉ
